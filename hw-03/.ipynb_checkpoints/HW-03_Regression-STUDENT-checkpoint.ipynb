This might seem confusing to you. Part of the reason for this is because we skipped a very important step regarding dealing with unfamiliar data, that is **visualizing the data**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Do this**: Make a scatterplot showing the penguins' body mass vs. bill depth. Color code the dots so that each species gets a different color. Then, display the best fit line for each of the three species using the same color and display the best fit line for all the penguins using a different color. Don't forget to label your axes. When you're done, you should have a plot that contains three different colors of dots and 4 different lines (3 of the lines should match the colors of the three penguin species, respectively)\n",

Now, suppose you wanted to write code that would take a penguins measurements (bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass) and predict which of the three species the penguin was. Describe how you would do this. **Note**: You don't need to actually implement this with code, you simply need to have a sufficiently detailed plan for how you *could* do it. "

Choose a logistic regression model, setting it up for multi-class classification and train the model on the training set. Test the model on the testing set and evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix. Develop a function that takes a penguin's measurements as input that preprocesses the input and then use the trained model to predict the species. Iterate on the model and function as needed based on performance."
